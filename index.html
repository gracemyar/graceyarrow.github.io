          <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
            <p>I first fell in love with journalism in ninth grade, taking a basic class on how to 
                format a lead and how to take a picture. I spent that year and all of 10th grade 
                writing stories about local events for my school newspaper.</p>
            <p>When my family moved to California after my sophomore year of high school, I leaned 
                on my writing to navigate the challenges of being a “new kid” in 11th grade. I met 
                all of my friends through my journalism class and got to know more of the student body 
                by reporting on local protests, changing detention policies and breaking news stories 
                as school was cancelled while wildfires ravaged Sonoma County.</p>
            <p>When searching for what to do after my high school graduation, I felt drawn to the coast 
                I was raised on, committing to the University of Maryland to pursue and develop my 
                attraction to journalism.</p>
            <p>In order to find my place in college, I experimented with copy editing and covering 
                Maryland softball during my freshman year. I spent hours picking through stories to 
                make sure we'd never issue a correction and learned about a sport I had no experience 
                in before COVID-19 shut the softball season down.</p>
            <p>As the pandemic continued to uproot the world, I made the difficult decision not to
                 return to Maryland for my sophomore year. Instead, I spent a year and a half working 
                 remotely for my hometown newspaper, The Press Democrat. I started as an intern and was 
                 promoted to an online producer position as I became familiar with the workflow of the
                  organization and furthered my news judgement and writing skills.</p>
            <p>As I made a great trek back to Maryland in the fall of 2021, I joined The Diamondback, 
                the independent student newspaper of the University of Maryland, as a city council reporter.</p>
            <p>I write two articles a week for The Diamondback, covering weekly College Park City Council 
                meetings and researching local issues like racial injustice and surveillance.</p>
            <p>Journalism has been my mechanism to process all sorts of change in my life since ninth 
                grade. The one thing I knew I could return to was a blank Google document and my ability 
                to talk to people and tell their stories.</p>
            <p>When I'm not thinking about city council legislation or franticly typing into my 
                laptop, you can find me in my apartment kitchen, baking cookies and breads for my 
                roommates, or in a practice room with my violin, working on a Mozart concerto I can 
                never seem to nail.</p>
