            <p>The College Park City Council has mapped out allocations for $22 million of federal COVID-19 pandemic 
                relief money in a proposed budget for the 2023 fiscal year.</p>
            <p>The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), passed in 2021 to deliver relief to state, 
                local and tribal governments amid the pandemic.</p>
            <p>The City of College Park's check — a total of $21,972,844 — was a part of ARPA's program for state 
                and local funding. The city will receive the funding in two installments of $10.99 million each, 
                according to city documents. The first portion arrived in July 2021 and the second half will arrive 
                in July of 2022.</p>
            <p>$10 million of the ARPA funding will go toward the city's general fund for the 2023 fiscal year, which 
                begins on July 1 and runs through June 30, 2023.</p>
            <p>“I'm very grateful to have these resources that we can put to respond to this pandemic and leading 
                some of our priorities that we have been trying to focus on as a community,” College Park Mayor 
                Patrick Wojahn said in a council meeting.</p>
            <p>The second-largest allocation of the ARPA money in 2022 is $3,175,000 for “grants and assistance,” 
                according to city documents.</p>

            <p>The majority of this category will be used for business and nonprofit assistance grants, which the 
                city is currently accepting applications for on its website. According to the city's website, 
                these grants are available to local businesses and nonprofits to help recover from financial 
                fallout from COVID-19.</p>
            <p>The newly released budget shows the rest of this “grants and assistance” category being split into
                 three parts.  $250,000 will go to food service organizations, $350,000 will go to family and 
                 individual financial assistance — which residents can apply for through the city website. The 
                 applications for family and organization grants will stay open until the funds are exhausted, 
                 said Michael Williams, the economic development manager.</p>
            <p>Also under the “grants and assistance” category, a $75,000 grant will be given to Shop Made in 
                Maryland, a store that will sell local products in retail spaces at City Hall.</p>
            <p>Among other planned projects for the ARPA funding is $100,000 to support the restorative justice 
                effort in the city's historically Black Lakeland neighborhood, which was destroyed by urban renewal
                 starting in the 1970s.</p>
            <p>The city has put aside $202,000 for the city's Capital Improvement Plan, which includes money 
                for playground replacements in College Park.</p>

    <p>Another $150,000 has been allocated for personal protective equipment, deep cleaning of city 
        facilities and other measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
    <p>According to the proposed budget, over $3 million of the funding has not been allocated to specific 
        projects yet, but could be used for affordable housing, neighborhood stabilization and revitalization,
        commercial revitalization and public facilities and recreation.</p>
    <p>The city's adjusted budget of proposed total expenditures of the ARPA funding for the 2022 fiscal 
        year is $17,606,835. The rest of the money, slightly over $4 million, will carry over into the 
        2023 fiscal year.</p>
    <p>The deadline to spend all of the ARPA money is Dec. 31, 2024, the proposed budget states.</p>
    <p>The council will hold a public hearing on the proposed budget for the 2023 fiscal year during its meeting 
        on Tuesday, May 10.</p>
    <p>District 1 council member Kate Kennedy has supported working on follow-up analysis of how the 
        funds are being used.</p>
    <p>“I'm hoping that we can also provide some support in terms of the management of that [funding]
         so that it gets used in the best way possible,” Kennedy said.</p>
